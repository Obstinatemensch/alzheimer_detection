# alzheimer_detection

The dataset used is the OASIS MRI dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninadaithal/imagesoasis), which consists of 80,000 brain MRI images. The images have been divided into four classes based on Alzheimer's progression.

All the code for processing and training the models are available in the ipynb file attached, not adding the models here to their large sizes

I used python 3.10.11, tensorflow 2.12.0, cudatoolkit 11.8.0 and cudnn 8.6
